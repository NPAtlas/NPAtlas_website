Versions are named `np_atlas_YYYY_MM`.

Data for each version should be stored inside a directory with this name.
Inside each, there should be three sub-directories: `clusters`, `nodes`,
`png`; as well as two text files: `global.csv`, and `NPAtlas_download.tsv`.

These contain the static resources loaded by the website.

Note they have not been included in this repository due to the size of the
data. Please contact us if these data are required, or for instructions on
how to generate them.
